Github Repository for CS 510 Project: Prediction of Aromatic Rings for Cancer Kinase Inhibitors Using Random Forest Model

Premise: SRC Kinase Inhibitors are important inhibitors for cancer proteins. A distincting factor of SRC Kinase Inhibitors and their existence is their ring count
and it acts as a very important feature for these molecules. In this project, I plan on predicting aromatic ring count given a list of 20 aggregate chemical features 
and using different machine learning models for comparison analysis. I start off by developing a basic Random Forest model and in the future, I will do a comparative 
analysis of this Random Forest model and another model to see prediction accuracy and variance levels. 

Data: SRC Kinase inhibitor Dataset(xlsx file)

Details: ~3000 molecules with ~20 aggregate chemical features
